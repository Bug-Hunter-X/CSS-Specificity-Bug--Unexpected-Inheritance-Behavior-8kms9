This repository demonstrates a common CSS specificity issue related to overriding styles with classes. The `bug.css` file showcases the problem where styles defined for unordered lists are not overridden by a class selector. The `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version addressing the specificity conflict.  The issue stems from the fact that the universal selector (`ul li`) has higher specificity than the class selector (`.special`).
